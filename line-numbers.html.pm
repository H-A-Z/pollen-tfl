◊hanging-topic[(topic-from-metas metas)]{Exact line spacing is the key}

If you practice in a jurisdiction that requires court filings with ◊em{line numbers}, you’ve faced the vexing problem of keeping the line numbers vertically aligned with the text. Looking at ◊xref{court opinions}, even judges are often defeated by this formatting task.

But the secret is simple: use exact ◊xref{line spacing} with the line numbers and the ◊xref{body text}.

For example, California state courts require filings to use double line spacing (which works out to 28 lines per page), 12-point type, and line numbers in the left margin. I’ll use this as a basic model and you can adapt it to the rules in your jurisdiction.
