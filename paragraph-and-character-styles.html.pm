Implementing good typography is often a chore and a bore. For everyone, not just for lawyers. ◊em{Paragraph and character styles} eliminate most of the drudgery.

Styles are the DNA of document layout. Styles make it easy to control typography across a single document. They also let you make templates that can be reused across multiple documents. The result is better, more consistent typography in every document with less work per document.

I find it curious that so many lawyers don’t know how to use styles. They format their documents the old-fashioned way: word by word and paragraph by paragraph.

Do you verify your spelling by having a human being read your draft? No, you use an automated spell-checker. Do you copy a document by putting each page on the photocopier glass? No, you put the whole thing in the sheet feeder.

If you plan to have a long-term relationship with good typography, I recommend you learn how to use styles too.
