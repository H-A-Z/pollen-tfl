Are you still making ◊em{bulleted and numbered lists} by manually typing bullets or numbers at the beginning of each line?

In the 21st century, no one should be doing this task by hand. Manually formatted lists are a waste of time and prone to error. I can get you started, but if you’re unfamiliar with automated lists, spend some time with your word processor’s manual or help file.

◊btw{
As I suggested in ◊xref{mixing fonts}, it’s acceptable to set a list index (i.e., a bullet or a number) in a different font than the list item itself. You can also make the list index a smaller point size.


Asterisks are sometimes used as bullets, but they’re not qualified for the job—they’re too small and too high.
