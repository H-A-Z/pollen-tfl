I once met a lawyer who had actually set his letterhead in a font called Stencil:

◊indented{◊image[#:border #f "kurtz.svg"]}

Who were his target clients? Army-surplus stores? He explained that he wanted something distinctive.

Distinctive is fine. Goofy is not.

From the top: no, no, no, no, and hell no.

Novelty fonts, script fonts, handwriting fonts, circus fonts — these have no place in any document created by a lawyer. Save it for your next career as a designer of breakfast-cereal boxes.
