◊(define-meta title "carriage returns")
◊hanging-topic[(topic-from-metas metas)]{Only when you want a new paragraph}

On manual typewriters, the ◊em{carriage} was the part on top that held the paper and scooted leftward as you typed. At the end of each line, you’d push a lever to move the carriage to the beginning of the next line. On electric typewriters, this lever became the ◊em{carriage return key}, which you’d press at the end of each line.

The terminology has stayed with us, but on a word processor, you only use a carriage return to start a new paragraph.

As with the ◊xref{word space}, use only one carriage return at a time. It’s common to see multiple carriage returns used to add vertical space between paragraphs. Bad idea. If you want vertical space after a paragraph, use ◊xref{space between paragraphs}.

“But it’s so much easier to type two carriage returns.” I know. But in long, structured documents, extra carriage returns create unpredictable consequences as the document is edited. Whatever time you save with the shortcut will cost you later.
