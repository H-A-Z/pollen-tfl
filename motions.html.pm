Litigators, I appreciate that motions are often written under deadline pressure that make good typography seem like an unaffordable luxury.

But when is it more important to have your reader’s full attention? You’re asking a judge to order a remedy — or, if you’re opposing, to refrain from ordering that remedy. The issue is important enough to have reached the judge’s desk. The ruling may not be appealable. Shouldn’t you put your best foot forward?

“Yes, but where do I find the time?” You take care of the typography before you write your motion—by setting up a motion template with paragraph and character styles that handle most of the typography chores as you write. When you get to the end, there’s not much left to do.

Or you can submit motions that look like they just rolled out of bed.
