◊(define-meta title "math symbols")
◊hanging-topic[(topic-from-metas metas)]{Use real characters, not alphabetic susbstitutes}

If you need ◊em{math symbols} infrequently — some light addition and subtraction, the occasional negative number — you can get by without special symbols. Use the plus sign ◊glyph{+} and equals sign ◊glyph{=} as usual. Use the en dash as a minus sign ◊glyph{–} (see ◊xref{hyphens and dashes}).

If you need to do multiplication or beyond, insert real math symbols by hand.
