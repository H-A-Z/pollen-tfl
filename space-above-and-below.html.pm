◊(define-meta title "space above and below")
◊hanging-topic[(topic-from-metas metas)]{Elegant emphasis}

If you hadn't figured it out yet, I'm a big fan of white space. On the outside edge of the page (see ◊xref{page margins}). Between capital letters (see ◊xref{letterspacing}). Within table cells (see ◊xref{tables}). Between paragraphs (see ◊xref{space between paragraphs}). 

And now, above and below a ◊xref{heading}, as a form of emphasis. To show you what I mean, let me ask you something. ◊u{◊strong{◊em{DO YOU FIND THIS TO BE AN INVITING FORM OF EMPHASIS?}}}

◊gap[6.5]

Or do you prefer this?

◊gap[7]

Well, there you have it. 

Space above and below works on the page for the same reason a dramatic pause works when you're talking. You draw a listener's attention through ◊em{contrast}. Loudness is an effective form of contrast. But so is silence. 

Likewise with the written word. Formatting tools like ◊xref{point size}, ◊xref{color}, and ◊xref{bold or italic} have a role to play. But careless typographers mate them indiscriminately, breeding noise. Space above and below gives you emphasis without adding a single mark to the page.
