Just as paper is yielding to PDF as the preferred format for discovery, manually stamped ◊em{Bates numbering} is yielding to digital numbering.

I prefer the convenience of digital Bates numbering. But I miss the look of the stamp. The blue ink and the distinct font made the number easy to spot on the page, even after being photocopied. Digital Bates numbering is often small, black, and set in Times New Roman or Arial — all of which camouflages the numbers.
