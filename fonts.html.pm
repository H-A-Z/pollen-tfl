When I started the ◊em{Typography for Lawyers} project, I was asked "MB, you've designed fonts before. Will you ever design one for lawyers?" 

Of course not, I thought. Lawyers hadn't even scratched the surface of the many excellent professional fonts already available.

But over time, lawyers kept nudging me — "it would be great if a font could do such-and-such …" After all, many of today's fonts — including ◊xref["a-brief-history-of-times-new-roman.html"]{Times New Roman} — were invented to suit the needs of earlier publishers. Why not lawyers?

Like most type designers, I found it impossible to resist an invitation to explore a new realm of typographic geekery. But I'm also happy to share the results with you: the ◊strong{TFL Fonts}, a set of four font families inspired by the needs of legal writers. 

The second edition of ◊em{Typography for Lawyers} uses all four: ◊xref{Equity} for ◊xref{body text}, ◊xref{Concourse} for captions and instructions, ◊xref{Triplicate} for typewriter-style samples, and ◊xref{Advocate} for headlines and the front cover. (Of course, you're also reading them right now.)

"Will these fonts comply with my local court rules?" I can't offer legal advice. But I can say that thousands of lawyers have been using the TFL Fonts without incident. In fact, they regularly tell me that judges, clients, and even opposing counsel notice & admire the appearance of their documents. 

◊em{Opposing counsel?} So I'm told. Your mileage may vary, however.
