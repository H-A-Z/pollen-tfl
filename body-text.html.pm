Please note:
◊strong{BODY TEXT}
is the most common 
element of a document. 
Therefore, how the body
text looks will have the 
most noticeable effect 
on the appearance 
of the document. 
Consequently, 
you should
set up the
body text 
◊strong{FIRST}.

Start with
font, ◊xref{point size}, 
◊xref{line spacing}, and
◊xref{line length}, because 
those four decisions will 
largely determine how 
the body text will 
look. OK?
