◊(define-meta title "accented characters")
◊hanging-topic[(topic-from-metas metas)]{Don’t ignore them}

I assume you’re writing in American English, but you might still encounter ◊em{accented characters} in foreign words. Foreign words arise in two situations:

◊numbered-list{

In proper names, like people and places (◊em{Albrecht Dürer, François Truffaut, Plácido Domingo}). In names, accented characters must always appear accurately. Otherwise, the name is misspelled.
   
   
In loanwords used in American English. Some of these words have become citizens and should be spelled without accents ◊em{(naive} for ◊em{naïve}, ◊em{melee} for ◊em{mêlée}, ◊em{coupe} for ◊em{coupé)}. Others have not and should not (◊em{cause célèbre}, ◊em{piña colada}, ◊em{Göt­ter­däm­merung}). Check a dictionary or usage guide.
