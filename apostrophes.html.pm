◊(define-meta title "apostrophes")
◊hanging-topic[(topic-from-metas metas)]{Make sure they’re curly and point downward}

The ◊em{apostrophe} has two functions we all remember from sixth-grade English class.

◊numbered-list{
An apostrophe indicates the possessive case ◊em{(Jessica’s bagel)}◊em{.}


In contractions, an apostrophe takes the place of letters or numbers that have been removed (◊em{is not} becomes ◊em{isn’t}, ◊em{Patent No. 5,269,211} becomes ◊em{’211}).
}


Apostrophes always point downward. If the smart-quote conversion feature of your writing system is on (see ◊xref{straight and curly quotes}), then type an apostrophe with the same key you use to type a straight single quote ◊glyph{'}. Your word processor will convert this character to a curly apostrophe ◊glyph{’}. Or you can type an apostrophe directly, using the same key as a closing single quote.
